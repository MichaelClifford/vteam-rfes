**Analyzed By**: Jack (Delivery Owner)
**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Spec**: /workspace/sessions/agentic-session-1760542766/workspace/vteam-rfes/specs/001-develop-a-new/spec.md
**Status**: BLOCKED - 21 CRITICAL CLARIFICATIONS REQUIRED

---

## Executive Summary

**DELIVERY RISK LEVEL: HIGH**

This feature is currently BLOCKED for implementation planning due to:
- **21 NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers** throughout the specification
- **8 HIGH PRIORITY architectural decisions** that must be made before any code is written
- **CRITICAL BLOCKER**: MCP client library at `/archive/mcp_client_integration` DOES NOT EXIST
- **CRITICAL RISK**: Python-Go language impedance mismatch is completely underspecified
- **30 Functional Requirements** creating significant scope risk for MVP delivery

**Recommended Action**: HALT implementation planning until architectural workshop resolves critical blockers (estimated 3-5 days).

**Estimated Discovery Overhead If We Proceed Without Resolution**: 2-3 weeks of implementation churn and rework.

---

## CRITICAL BLOCKERS (Must Resolve Before Planning)

### BLOCKER 1: MCP Client Library Does Not Exist
**Status**: BLOCKING
**Impact**: Cannot start implementation
**Owner**: TBD

**Issue**:
- Spec references MCP client library at `/archive/mcp_client_integration` (Python)
- RFE states "The vTeam codebase already contains an MCP client integration library (archived in `/archive/mcp_client_integration`)"
- **VALIDATION RESULT**: This path does not exist in the current repository
- Current backend is Go, referenced client is Python - language mismatch

**Dependencies**:
- All implementation tasks depend on this being resolved
- Backend refactoring (FR-006 through FR-013) blocked
- Integration testing blocked

**Mitigation Options**:
1. **Option A**: Build a Go MCP client from scratch
   - **Timeline**: 1-2 weeks development + testing
   - **Risk**: Protocol complexity, no reference implementation
   - **Advantage**: Native Go integration, no language bridge needed

2. **Option B**: Use Python MCP client via HTTP/gRPC sidecar
   - **Timeline**: 1 week for sidecar + integration
   - **Risk**: Additional deployment complexity, inter-process communication overhead
   - **Advantage**: Can leverage existing Python MCP libraries

3. **Option C**: Use Python MCP client via subprocess wrapper
   - **Timeline**: 3-4 days for wrapper
   - **Risk**: Process management complexity, error handling challenges
   - **Advantage**: Simple integration pattern

4. **Option D**: Find existing Go MCP client library
   - **Timeline**: 2-3 days research + evaluation
   - **Risk**: May not exist or may not support Atlassian MCP Server features
   - **Advantage**: Supported library, faster integration

**Required Action**:
- [ ] Technical lead conducts 2-day spike to evaluate options
- [ ] Architecture decision document created with chosen approach
- [ ] Update spec with BINDING decision in "Technical Architecture Decisions" section
- [ ] Adjust timeline estimates based on chosen option

**ETA Impact**: +5 to +10 days before implementation can begin

### BLOCKER 2: OAuth Token Storage Model Undefined
**Status**: BLOCKING
**Impact**: Security architecture, data model, UI flow
**Owner**: TBD

**Issue**:
- FR-011: "System MUST store OAuth tokens [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: per-project in individual secrets or globally in a shared secret?]"
- FR-024: "System MUST allow [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: per-project or global?] configuration"
- This decision affects: RFEWorkflow CRD schema, Kubernetes secret management, UI configuration flow

**Dependencies**:
- Backend API design blocked
- Frontend configuration UI design blocked
- Security review cannot proceed
- Data model cannot be finalized

**Decision Required**:

**Option A: Per-Project OAuth Tokens**
- **Pros**: Security isolation, multi-tenant friendly, different Atlassian instances per project
- **Cons**: More complex UX, users must configure OAuth per project, higher token management overhead
- **Storage**: One Kubernetes secret per project/namespace
- **UX Impact**: Configuration step required for every project

**Option B: Global OAuth Token**
- **Pros**: Simpler UX, one-time admin configuration, shared across all projects
- **Cons**: Single point of failure, all projects use same Atlassian account, no multi-tenancy
- **Storage**: One global Kubernetes secret
- **UX Impact**: Admin-only configuration, users just use it

**Required Action**:
- [ ] Product Manager decides based on target customer use cases
- [ ] Security team reviews chosen approach for compliance
- [ ] Update FR-011, FR-024 with binding decision
- [ ] Update OAuth Configuration entity schema in spec

**Owner**: TBD

**Issue**:
- FR-012: "System MUST handle OAuth token expiration by [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: automatic silent refresh, or prompting user to re-authenticate?]"
- Scenario 4: "Given OAuth token has expired, When user attempts to publish to Jira, Then system [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]"
- This affects error handling patterns, retry logic, user interruptions

**Dependencies**:
- Error handling implementation blocked (FR-014 through FR-020)
- OAuth token lifecycle management blocked
- User experience flow cannot be finalized

**Decision Required**:

**Option A: Silent Automatic Refresh**
- **Pros**: Zero user interruption, seamless experience
- **Cons**: Requires storing refresh tokens securely, complex token lifecycle management, may fail silently
- **UX**: User never sees token expiration (unless refresh fails)

**Option B: Prompt User to Re-authenticate**
- **Pros**: Simpler implementation, explicit user consent
- **Cons**: User interruption, friction in workflow, may happen during critical operations
- **UX**: User sees "Re-authenticate" prompt when token expires

**Option C: Hybrid (Attempt Silent Refresh, Prompt on Failure)**
- **Pros**: Best of both worlds, minimal user interruption
- **Cons**: Most complex implementation, requires careful error handling
- **UX**: Mostly seamless, occasional re-auth prompts

**Required Action**:
- [ ] UX architect decides based on acceptable interruption levels
- [ ] Update FR-012 and Scenario 4 with binding decision
- [ ] Document error handling flows for all token expiration scenarios
- [ ] Update error message catalog with appropriate messages

**ETA Impact**: +1 day for decision + spec update

**Owner**: TBD

**Issue**:
- FR-021: "System MUST handle Atlassian MCP Server rate limits (1,000 requests/hour for Premium) by [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: queuing requests, failing fast with clear error, or warning users proactively?]"
- Scenario 5: "Given Atlassian rate limit reached, When user attempts to publish, Then system [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]"
- Scenario 8: "Given multiple workspace files are unpublished, When user selects files and clicks publish, Then system [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: publishes one at a time sequentially, or publishes in parallel?]"

**Dependencies**:
- Batch publishing design blocked (FR-030, post-MVP feature)
- Error handling for rate limits blocked (FR-018)
- Performance characteristics undefined

**Decision Required**:

**Option A: Fail Fast with Retry Timing**
- **Pros**: Simple implementation, clear user feedback, no state management
- **Cons**: User must manually retry, poor UX during high usage
- **UX**: Error message "Rate limit reached. Try again in 45 minutes"

**Option B: Queue Requests with Estimated Completion**
- **Pros**: Best UX, automatic handling, no user intervention
- **Cons**: Complex state management, requires persistence, unclear failure modes
- **UX**: "Request queued. Publishing in ~30 minutes"

**Option C: Client-Side Throttling (Prevent Rate Limit)**
- **Pros**: Proactive, users never hit limit, smooth experience
- **Cons**: Requires tracking usage across all users, complex coordination
- **UX**: "Publishing... (rate limit protection active)"

**Option D: Hybrid (Throttle + Queue on Burst)**
- **Pros**: Balanced approach, handles normal and burst usage
- **Cons**: Most complex implementation
- **UX**: Usually instant, occasional queueing during bursts

**Required Action**:
- [ ] Product Manager decides based on user impact tolerance
- [ ] Engineering assesses implementation complexity of each option
- [ ] Update FR-021, FR-018, Scenario 5, Scenario 8 with binding decision
- [ ] Document rate limit tracking mechanism in technical architecture

**ETA Impact**: +2 days for decision + design

### BLOCKER 5: Re-Publish Behavior Undefined
**Status**: BLOCKING
**Impact**: User experience, data model, Jira API usage
**Owner**: TBD

**Issue**:
- FR-029: "System MUST handle re-publishing of already-linked files by [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: creating new issue, updating existing issue, or prompting user to choose?]"
- Scenario 3: "Given a file is already published to Jira (has jiraLinks entry), When user clicks 'Publish to Jira' on that file again, Then system [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]"
- Edge Cases: "What happens when multiple users simultaneously publish the same file?"

**Dependencies**:
- jiraLinks data model schema blocked
- Duplicate issue prevention logic blocked
- Concurrency handling blocked

**Decision Required**:

**Option A: Always Create New Issue**
- **Pros**: Simple, no complexity, clear behavior
- **Cons**: Can create duplicate issues, Jira clutter, no update capability
- **Data Model**: jiraLinks becomes an array (one file -> many issues)

**Option B: Always Update Existing Issue**
- **Pros**: Single source of truth, keeps Jira clean
- **Cons**: May overwrite manual Jira changes, requires tracking which issue to update
- **Data Model**: jiraLinks tracks single issue per file

**Option C: Prompt User to Choose**
- **Pros**: User control, flexible
- **Cons**: Adds UX friction, requires decision point
- **UX**: Modal dialog "This file is already published to PROJ-123. [Create New] [Update Existing] [Cancel]"

**Option D: Disable Re-Publish (Show "View in Jira" Only)**
- **Pros**: Simplest MVP, prevents confusion
- **Cons**: No update capability, users must manually update in Jira
- **UX**: Publish button replaced with Jira badge after first publish

**Required Action**:
- [ ] Product Manager decides based on primary use case
- [ ] Update FR-029, Scenario 3, Edge Cases with binding decision

### BLOCKER 7: File Rename/Move Tracking Strategy Undefined
**Status**: BLOCKING
**Impact**: Data model integrity, user experience
**Owner**: TBD

**Issue**:
- FR-030: "System MUST handle workspace file rename/move operations by [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: tracking by path (breaks on rename) or by content hash (maintains link)?]"
- Edge Cases: "What happens when a workspace file is renamed but has an existing Jira link? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should jiraLinks track by file path or content hash?]"

**Dependencies**:
- jiraLinks schema design blocked
- File operations handling blocked
- User expectations undefined

**Decision Required**:

**Option A: Track by File Path (Breaks on Rename)**
- **Pros**: Simple implementation, matches user mental model
- **Cons**: Links lost on rename/move, user frustration
- **Data Model**: `jiraLinks: [{filePath: string, jiraKey: string}]`
- **UX**: "This file was renamed. Jira link was lost."

**Option B: Track by Content Hash (Maintains Link)**
- **Pros**: Links survive rename/move, better data integrity
- **Cons**: Complex implementation, hash collisions (rare), doesn't handle edits well
- **Data Model**: `jiraLinks: [{fileHash: string, filePath: string, jiraKey: string}]`
- **UX**: Transparent, links just work

**Option C: Track by File ID (If Workspace Has File IDs)**
- **Pros**: Best of both worlds, stable identifier
- **Cons**: Requires workspace file ID system (may not exist)
- **Data Model**: `jiraLinks: [{fileId: string, jiraKey: string}]`
- **Prerequisite**: Workspace must provide stable file identifiers

**Required Action**:
- [ ] Engineering investigates if workspace provides stable file identifiers
- [ ] Product Manager decides based on rename frequency in user workflows
- [ ] Update FR-030 and Edge Cases with binding decision
- [ ] Update jiraLinks schema in Key Entities section

### BLOCKER 8: Multiple File Publishing Behavior Undefined
**Status**: BLOCKING
**Impact**: User experience, performance, rate limiting
**Owner**: TBD

**Issue**:
- Scenario 8: "Given multiple workspace files are unpublished, When user selects files and clicks publish, Then system [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: publishes one at a time sequentially, or publishes in parallel with per-file status tracking?]"
- Out of Scope: "Batch publishing UI: Multiple file selection and bulk publish is post-MVP (single file at a time in MVP)"
- CONFLICT: Scenario 8 implies batch publishing, but Out of Scope says it's post-MVP

**Dependencies**:
- MVP scope definition blocked
- UI implementation approach blocked
- Rate limit strategy depends on this (BLOCKER 4)

**Decision Required**:

**Option A: MVP = Single File Only (Simplest)**
- **Pros**: Clear MVP scope, avoids batch complexity
- **Cons**: Users must publish files one at a time manually
- **UX**: No multi-select UI, one "Publish" button per file
- **Scope**: Remove Scenario 8 from MVP acceptance criteria

**Option B: MVP = Sequential Batch**
- **Pros**: Better UX than Option A, simpler than parallel
- **Cons**: Slow for many files, still blocks on rate limits
- **UX**: Multi-select UI, progress indicator, sequential processing
- **Scope**: Scenario 8 stays in MVP

**Option C: MVP = Parallel Batch**
- **Pros**: Best UX, fastest processing
- **Cons**: Complex error handling, rate limit coordination, per-file status tracking
- **UX**: Multi-select UI, per-file status badges, parallel execution
- **Scope**: Scenario 8 stays in MVP with full complexity

**Required Action**:
- [ ] Product Manager clarifies MVP scope (is batch publishing in or out?)
- [ ] If IN: Choose sequential vs parallel approach
- [ ] If OUT: Remove Scenario 8 from MVP acceptance criteria
- [ ] Update Out of Scope section for consistency
- [ ] Adjust FR requirements to match decision

**ETA Impact**: +1 day for decision + scope clarification

## HIGH PRIORITY RISKS (Should Resolve for Better Spec)

### RISK 1: Health Monitoring Visibility Undefined
**Category**: Observability
**Priority**: High
**Impact**: Support operations, user experience

**Issue**:
- FR-023: "System MUST provide health check endpoints exposing MCP server connectivity status [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: visible to end users, project admins, or platform admins only?]"
- Acceptance Criteria: "MCP server health status is visible to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: administrators only, or also end users?]"

**Risk**:
- Exposing infrastructure health to end users may cause alarm during transient issues
- Not exposing to end users reduces transparency and self-service troubleshooting
- Support team may be overwhelmed if users cannot self-diagnose

**Mitigation Options**:
1. **Admin-Only Visibility**: Keep infrastructure details internal
   - **Risk**: Users cannot self-diagnose, increased support load
2. **End User Visibility**: Show simple status indicator
   - **Risk**: User panic during transient outages
3. **Tiered Visibility**: Simple status for users, detailed metrics for admins
   - **Risk**: Increased implementation complexity

**Recommended Action**:
- [ ] Product Manager decides based on support strategy
- [ ] Update FR-023 and Acceptance Criteria with decision
- [ ] Document visibility levels in observability section

---

### RISK 2: Stale Link Handling Undefined
**Category**: Data Integrity
**Priority**: High
**Impact**: User trust, data accuracy

**Issue**:
- Edge Cases: "What happens when a Jira issue is deleted externally but vTeam still has the jiraLink? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should system validate links periodically, show broken link indicator, or leave stale?]"
- Key Entities: "JiraLinks persist even if the Jira issue is deleted externally [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should system validate periodically?]"

**Risk**:
- Stale links reduce user trust in system
- 404 errors when clicking links frustrate users
- Periodic validation adds load to Atlassian API (rate limit impact)

**Mitigation Options**:
1. **No Validation (Leave Stale)**: Simplest MVP
   - **Risk**: Broken links, user frustration, low trust
2. **Lazy Validation (On Click)**: Check when user clicks link
   - **Risk**: Slow clicks, still shows broken badge
3. **Periodic Background Validation**: Async job validates links
   - **Risk**: API rate limit consumption, complex job scheduling
4. **User-Triggered Validation**: "Refresh Status" button
   - **Risk**: Manual action required, links may stay stale

**Recommended Action**:
- [ ] Product Manager decides based on user tolerance for stale data
- [ ] Consider rate limit budget for validation approach
- [ ] Update Edge Cases section with binding decision
- [ ] Add validation task to implementation plan if chosen

---

### RISK 3: Concurrent Publishing Conflict Handling Undefined
**Category**: Data Consistency
**Priority**: Medium
**Impact**: Edge case reliability

**Issue**:
- Edge Cases: "What happens when multiple users simultaneously publish the same file? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should system detect conflicts, allow duplicate issues, or use locking?]"

**Risk**:
- Race conditions could create duplicate Jira issues
- Locking adds complexity and potential deadlocks
- Allowing duplicates pollutes Jira with redundant issues

**Mitigation Options**:
1. **Allow Duplicates**: Simplest, no coordination
   - **Risk**: Duplicate issues in Jira, user confusion
2. **Optimistic Locking**: CRD versioning prevents race
   - **Risk**: One user's publish fails, must retry
3. **Pessimistic Locking**: Lock file during publish
   - **Risk**: Deadlock potential, complex timeout handling
4. **Idempotency Check**: Check if issue exists before creating
   - **Risk**: Not foolproof, timing window still exists

**Recommended Action**:
- [ ] Engineering assesses race condition likelihood (how often?)
- [ ] Product Manager decides acceptable behavior
- [ ] Update Edge Cases section with decision
- [ ] Document expected behavior in user docs

---

### RISK 4: Large File Handling Undefined
**Category**: Data Validation
**Priority**: Medium
**Impact**: User experience, error prevention

**Issue**:
- Edge Cases: "What happens when a workspace file exceeds Jira's description field limit (32,767 characters)? System should warn."
- Requirements lack proactive validation before publish

**Risk**:
- Publishing large files fails after API call (wasted rate limit quota)
- Error message comes too late in workflow
- User must manually truncate or split content

**Mitigation Options**:
1. **Reactive Error**: Catch API error, show message
   - **Risk**: Poor UX, wasted API call
2. **Proactive Warning**: Check size before publish, warn user
   - **Risk**: Still requires user to manually fix
3. **Auto-Truncation**: Truncate with "...continued in comments"
   - **Risk**: Data loss, Jira issue incomplete
4. **Auto-Split**: Create multiple linked issues
   - **Risk**: Complex logic, consumes multiple rate limit slots

**Recommended Action**:
- [ ] Product Manager decides acceptable behavior
- [ ] Add FR for file size validation if proactive approach chosen
- [ ] Update Edge Cases with binding decision
- [ ] Add validation task to implementation plan

**Category**: User Experience
**Priority**: Medium
**Impact**: Edge case UX

**Issue**: OAuth popup manual close handling, timeout duration undefined

**Mitigation**: Define timeout (suggest 5 minutes) and clear error message

---

### RISK 6: Jira Permission Pre-Validation Timing
**Category**: User Experience
**Priority**: Medium
**Impact**: Error timing, configuration UX

**Issue**: Check permissions during config or at publish time?

**Mitigation**: Recommend during config (Test Connection) to fail fast

---

### RISK 7: OAuth Configuration Help Format
**Category**: Documentation
**Priority**: Low
**Impact**: User onboarding

**Issue**: Video walkthrough vs text guide preference

**Mitigation**: Can decide during documentation phase

- Adds 5-10 days to timeline (see BLOCKER 1 mitigation)
- May require additional infrastructure components (sidecar container)
- Testing complexity increases significantly
- Operational complexity (logs, monitoring, debugging across language boundary)

**Mitigation**:
- See BLOCKER 1 mitigation options
- **REQUIRED**: Technical spike BEFORE any implementation planning
- **REQUIRED**: Proof-of-concept for chosen approach
- **REQUIRED**: Document operational implications (deployment, monitoring, debugging)

---

### TECH RISK 2: OAuth Token Lifecycle Management
**Severity**: HIGH
**Probability**: 80% (common OAuth challenge)
**Impact**: Security, user experience, reliability

**Description**:
- OAuth tokens expire and must be refreshed
- Refresh tokens can be revoked
- Token storage must be secure (encryption at rest)
- Token refresh must be atomic (no race conditions)

**Risk Details**:
- Race conditions in token refresh (multiple requests trigger multiple refreshes)
- Token expiration during publish operation (partial state)
- Refresh token revocation handling (user must re-authenticate)
- Secret rotation coordination (Kubernetes secret updates)

**Impact on Delivery**:
- Complex state machine for token lifecycle
- Edge cases are hard to test (requires time manipulation)
- Security review may identify issues late

**Mitigation**:
- [ ] Implement token refresh with mutex/lock to prevent races
- [ ] Store token expiration time, check before use
- [ ] Implement retry logic for expired tokens
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging for token lifecycle events
- [ ] Test with short-lived tokens (override expiration for tests)
- [ ] Document OAuth troubleshooting guide for users

---

### TECH RISK 3: Rate Limiting Strategy Implementation
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Probability**: 60% (depends on user volume)
**Impact**: User experience, system reliability

**Description**:
- Atlassian MCP Server rate limits: 1,000 req/hour (Premium)
- Rate limits are per OAuth app, shared across all vTeam users
- No visibility into current rate limit consumption
- Hitting rate limit blocks all users

**Risk Details**:
- Shared rate limit means one project's heavy usage affects all projects
- No API to query remaining rate limit quota
- 429 errors must be handled gracefully
- Retry timing must be coordinated across users

**Impact on Delivery**:
- Requires distributed rate limit tracking (if client-side throttling chosen)
- Queue implementation complexity (if queueing chosen)
- Error message must explain shared limit (user education)

**Mitigation**:
- [ ] Implement rate limit backoff with exponential retry
- [ ] Track approximate rate limit usage (client-side counter)
- [ ] Add metrics for rate limit hits (observability)
- [ ] Document rate limit behavior for users
- [ ] Consider per-project rate limit "budgets" to prevent one project consuming all quota
- [ ] Alert admins when approaching rate limit

---

### TECH RISK 4: MCP Server Reliability and Error Handling
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Probability**: 40% (depends on Atlassian infrastructure)
**Impact**: User experience, system availability

**Description**:
- vTeam depends on external Atlassian MCP Server
- Network failures, timeouts, degraded performance
- MCP protocol errors vs Jira API errors
- Unclear error message mapping

**Risk Details**:
- MCP server outages render Jira publishing completely unavailable
- Transient errors (network blips) vs permanent errors (bad config)
- Error messages from MCP server may be technical, not user-friendly
- Timeout configuration: too short (false failures), too long (slow UX)

**Impact on Delivery**:
- Requires comprehensive error taxonomy
- User-facing error messages must be crafted carefully
- Circuit breaker implementation to prevent cascading failures
- Health monitoring dashboard for MCP connectivity

**Mitigation**:
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker pattern (fail fast after N consecutive errors)
- [ ] Set reasonable timeouts (suggest 10s for publish operations)
- [ ] Map MCP/Jira errors to user-friendly messages
- [ ] Add retry logic with backoff for transient errors
- [ ] Monitor Atlassian status page, show in health dashboard
- [ ] Document expected behavior during Atlassian outages

---

### TECH RISK 5: RFEWorkflow CRD Schema Evolution
**Severity**: LOW
**Probability**: 30% (depends on production usage)
**Impact**: Data migration, backward compatibility

**Description**:
- Adding `jiraLinks` field to existing RFEWorkflow CRD
- Existing workflow instances in production must continue working
- Future schema changes (if jiraLinks structure evolves)

**Risk Details**:
- New field may require CRD version bump
- Existing workflows have null/undefined jiraLinks (must handle gracefully)
- If jiraLinks cardinality changes (one-to-one vs one-to-many), migration required

**Impact on Delivery**:
- Requires coordination with Platform team for CRD updates
- May require database migration for existing workflows
- Testing backward compatibility adds coverage burden

**Mitigation**:
- [ ] Design jiraLinks field as optional (nullable)
- [ ] Implement backward-compatible schema addition (CRD v1beta1 -> v1)
- [ ] Add validation to prevent malformed jiraLinks entries
- [ ] Test with existing workflows (null jiraLinks handling)
- [ ] Document migration path if schema changes in future

## DELIVERY RISKS

### DELIVERY RISK 1: Scope Creep (30 Functional Requirements)
**Severity**: HIGH
**Probability**: 70% (common pattern)
**Impact**: Timeline, MVP quality

**Description**:
- Spec contains 30 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-030)
- 21 NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers indicate incomplete definition
- Many "nice-to-have" features included in MVP (proactive warnings, health monitoring, rich tooltips)
- Acceptance Criteria split into MVP Phase 1 (9 items) and Post-MVP Phase 2 (2 items)

**Risk Details**:
- Team may attempt to implement all 30 FRs, leading to delays
- "Should Have" features may be prioritized incorrectly as "Must Have"
- Error handling alone has 7 FRs (FR-014 through FR-020) - significant scope
- Configuration management has 4 FRs (FR-024 through FR-027) - complex UX
- Rate limiting has 3 FRs (FR-021 through FR-023) - strategic decisions required

**Impact on Delivery**:
- 30 FRs could easily become 8-12 weeks of work
- MVP delivery date at risk
- Quality suffers if scope not reduced (rushed implementation)

**Mitigation - MVP Slicing Recommendation**:

**Phase 1 MVP (Must Have - 2-3 weeks):**
- FR-001: Publish individual files to Jira
- FR-002: Create issues with basic summary/description
- FR-005: Track jiraLinks in RFEWorkflow CR
- FR-006: OAuth 2.0 authentication
- FR-007: OAuth configuration UI
- FR-009: Connection status display
- FR-014: Basic error messages (config missing, connection failed)
- FR-028: Persist jiraLinks data model

**Phase 2 (Should Have - 1-2 weeks after MVP):**
- FR-003, FR-004: Clickable Jira links in UI
- FR-008: OAuth consent flow (popup + fallback)
- FR-010: Test Connection capability
- FR-015, FR-016, FR-017: Enhanced error messages
- FR-020: Success confirmation toasts
- FR-025: Default project/issue type selection

**Phase 3 (Nice to Have - Future):**
- FR-011, FR-012, FR-013: Advanced token lifecycle management
- FR-018: Rate limit retry timing
- FR-019: Detailed loading indicators
- FR-021, FR-022, FR-023: Advanced rate limit handling
- FR-026: Project key validation
- FR-029, FR-030: Re-publish and rename handling

**Post-MVP (Explicitly Deferred):**
- Batch publishing (FR-030, Scenario 8)
- Proactive token health monitoring (Phase 2 acceptance)
- Rich tooltips with issue details (Phase 2 acceptance)
- Custom field mapping (Out of Scope)
- Self-hosted MCP server support (Out of Scope for MVP)

**Required Action**:
- [ ] Product Manager formally approves MVP phase 1 scope
- [ ] Remove non-MVP requirements from acceptance criteria
- [ ] Update spec with explicit MVP boundary
- [ ] Communicate scope decisions to stakeholders

---

### DELIVERY RISK 2: 21 NEEDS CLARIFICATION Items Blocking Implementation
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Probability**: 100% (documented in spec)
**Impact**: Cannot start implementation planning

**Description**:
- Spec contains 21 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
- 8 marked as HIGH PRIORITY (must resolve before planning)
- 9 marked as MEDIUM PRIORITY (should clarify for better spec)
- 4 marked as LOW PRIORITY (can defer to planning)

**Risk Details**:
- Implementation cannot begin until HIGH PRIORITY items resolved
- Medium priority items will cause mid-implementation rework if not resolved
- Clarification process requires coordination across Product, UX, Engineering, Security
- Each clarification may require additional investigation or prototyping

**Impact on Delivery**:
- Estimated 3-5 days to resolve HIGH PRIORITY clarifications
- Architectural workshop required (half-day session)
- Spec revision required after decisions made
- Stakeholder review cycle adds 2-3 days

**Mitigation**:
- See section "Critical Blockers" above for detailed mitigation per item
- **REQUIRED**: Architectural workshop scheduled within 48 hours
- **REQUIRED**: Product Manager prioritizes clarification decisions
- **REQUIRED**: Technical spike for MCP client investigation (BLOCKER 1)

**Timeline Impact**:
- +5 to +7 days before implementation planning can begin
- This time is CRITICAL PATH - cannot be parallelized with implementation

---

### DELIVERY RISK 3: Missing Technical Decisions Affecting Architecture
**Severity**: HIGH
**Probability**: 100% (documented in spec)
**Impact**: Architecture, implementation approach

**Description**:
- Spec identifies "Technical Architecture Decisions (BINDING)" section
- 4 critical decisions are incomplete:
  1. MCP Client Integration approach
  2. OAuth Token Storage Model
  3. MCP Server Hosting Model
  4. Rate Limit Strategy

**Risk Details**:
- These decisions are BINDING (cannot change after implementation starts)
- Wrong decision requires significant rework
- Decisions are interdependent (OAuth model affects rate limit strategy)
- Security and compliance review required after decisions made

**Impact on Delivery**:
- Cannot design backend API until these are resolved
- Cannot design frontend UX until these are resolved
- Cannot estimate effort until approach is clear
- Security review is blocked until decisions made

**Mitigation**:
- See BLOCKER 1, 2, 4, 6 for detailed options
- **REQUIRED**: Architecture decision records (ADRs) for each decision
- **REQUIRED**: Stakeholder sign-off on binding decisions
- **REQUIRED**: Document alternatives considered and rationale

**Timeline Impact**:
- +2 to +3 days for decision-making process
- +1 day for security review of chosen approaches

---

### DELIVERY RISK 4: External Dependency on Atlassian Infrastructure
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Probability**: 30% (depends on Atlassian reliability)
**Impact**: Feature availability, user trust

**Description**:
- Entire feature depends on Atlassian MCP Server uptime
- No fallback mechanism if Atlassian services are down
- Users may perceive vTeam as unreliable if Atlassian has outages

**Risk Details**:
- Atlassian SLA: [unknown - research required]
- Historical uptime: [research status.atlassian.com incidents]
- No control over Atlassian infrastructure
- Rate limits may change without notice

**Impact on Delivery**:
- May need circuit breaker implementation (additional scope)
- May need fallback messaging/queue system (significant scope addition)
- Documentation must set user expectations

**Mitigation**:
- [ ] Research Atlassian uptime history
- [ ] Implement health monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Document expected behavior during outages
- [ ] Set user expectations in documentation (external dependency)
- [ ] Consider graceful degradation (show cached status during outages)
- [ ] Monitor status.atlassian.com, display in admin dashboard

---

### DELIVERY RISK 5: OAuth Configuration Complexity Barrier
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Probability**: 60% (identified by UX architect in spec)
**Impact**: User adoption, support burden

**Description**:
- OAuth setup requires creating OAuth app in Atlassian Developer Console
- Previous implementation used simple API tokens (email + token)
- OAuth has more setup steps, may discourage adoption

**Risk Details**:
- Users without Atlassian admin access cannot complete setup
- OAuth app approval process may take days (corporate policies)
- Red Hat internal users may face additional approval hurdles
- Non-technical Product Managers may struggle with OAuth concepts

**Impact on Delivery**:
- Requires comprehensive documentation with screenshots
- May require admin-configured global OAuth (bypass user setup)
- Support team needs training on OAuth troubleshooting
- User adoption may be lower than expected

**Mitigation**:
- [ ] Create detailed OAuth setup guide with screenshots
- [ ] Provide video walkthrough for OAuth configuration
- [ ] Offer global OAuth option (admin-configured, users just authorize)
- [ ] Test OAuth setup with non-technical users (UX validation)
- [ ] Document common OAuth errors and solutions
- [ ] Create troubleshooting flowchart for support team

---

### DELIVERY RISK 6: Test Infrastructure and Integration Testing Complexity
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Probability**: 70% (OAuth and external API testing is complex)
**Impact**: Test coverage, QA timeline

**Description**:
- OAuth flow testing requires real Atlassian account
- MCP server integration requires test environment
- Rate limit testing may consume production quota
- Token expiration testing requires time manipulation

**Risk Details**:
- Cannot use production Atlassian account for automated tests (rate limits)
- Test Atlassian account setup requires OAuth app creation
- Token expiration edge cases are hard to reproduce
- Concurrent publishing tests require complex coordination

**Impact on Delivery**:
- QA environment setup adds time
- Test coverage may be incomplete (hard-to-test scenarios)
- May need mock MCP server for unit tests (additional development)

**Mitigation**:
- [ ] Set up dedicated Atlassian Cloud test account
- [ ] Create OAuth test app with test credentials
- [ ] Implement mock MCP server for unit tests (avoid rate limits)
- [ ] Use short-lived test tokens (override expiration for tests)
- [ ] Document test environment setup in README
- [ ] Separate integration tests (real Atlassian) from unit tests (mocks)
